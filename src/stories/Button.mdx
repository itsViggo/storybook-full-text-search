# Button

A button is used to initiate an action when clicked. For primary actions, use a primary button.

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.Primary} />

For other actions use a secondary button

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.Secondary} />

There are also large and small variants to account for different use cases.
